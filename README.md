## PROJECT OVERVIEW
As a data analyst working for an advertising agency, Client A, a
cosmetic company, has been implementing digital advertising across
various channels such as search, display, and social media. They
seek your expertise in understanding the seasonality and devising
effective marketing campaign strategies for peak seasons to optimize
sales.
What approach would you recommend taking in this scenario?

## Analysis Process

we'll walk through our strategic analytical process, beginning with the identification of key metrics, as crucial indicators of our performance. We then methodically collect pertinent data from our databases, crucial for the subsequent step—analyzing sales trends to uncover underlying patterns. Finally, we evaluate our campaign's effectiveness by measuring outcomes against our initial metrics, completing the cycle of data-driven decision-making and strategic insight.

### Step 1: Identify Key Metrics

To analyze seasonality, I'll focus on Sales Volume to gauge revenue fluctuations, while Web Traffic and Keyword Search Volume will provide insights into customer engagement on the website. To identify the campaign performance, I'll leverage Attributed Sales, Conversion Rate, and ROAS to measure campaign strategy efficacy and pinpoint opportunities for optimization.

### Step 2: Collect Data From Database

Once I know what metrics I need to use, I would collect the data from the relevant database.

### Step 3: Analyze Sales Seasonality with Visualizations

I translated those datasets into powerbi and started to explore patterns. Based on these insights, dark green represents sales and yellow represents how the group of users interact with the website. I found that they had the first peak at new year, second peak at valentine’s day, third peak during summer holidays and fourth and fifth at thanksgiving and christmas. The Keyword Search Volume had the same pattern. They also had peak holiday seasons. I was able to determine that during these holiday seasons, the company had significant sales.

### Step 4 (1) : Create Measures in Power BI

Since all of the datasets don't obtain those metrics, I created measures in power bi. 
And I was able to get insights about how each channel was performing. 

### Step 4 (2): Analyze Campaign Effectiveness with Visualizations
<img width="891" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-07 at 16 10 20" src="https://github.com/WuCandice/Marketing-Campaign-Analysis/assets/127648422/52bb4284-b8e0-4c09-a35d-d84e89d8aa35">
The data reveals that the Search channel had the highest Attributed Sales, conversion rate, ROAS, and Net Profit, followed by Social. However, the Display channel shows a negative profit, with the lowest Conversion Rate and ROAS. Those insights indicate that we should invest more on search channels during the holiday season and optimize the display channel.
