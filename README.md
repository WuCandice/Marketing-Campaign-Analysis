## PROJECT OVERVIEW
As a data analyst working for an advertising agency, Client A, a
cosmetic company, has been implementing digital advertising across
various channels such as search, display, and social media. They
seek your expertise in understanding the seasonality and devising
effective marketing campaign strategies for peak seasons to optimize
sales.
What approach would you recommend taking in this scenario?

we'll walk through our strategic analytical process, beginning with the identification of key metrics, as crucial indicators of our performance. We then methodically collect pertinent data from our databases, crucial for the subsequent stepâ€”analyzing sales trends to uncover underlying patterns. Finally, we evaluate our campaign's effectiveness by measuring outcomes against our initial metrics, completing the cycle of data-driven decision-making and strategic insight.

To analyze seasonality, I'll focus on Sales Volume to gauge revenue fluctuations, while Web Traffic and Keyword Search Volume will provide insights into customer engagement on the website. To identify the campaign performance, I'll leverage Attributed Sales, Conversion Rate, and ROAS to measure campaign strategy efficacy and pinpoint opportunities for optimization.
